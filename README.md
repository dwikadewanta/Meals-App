# Meals App

## Project Description
"Meals App is an application that functions like a cookbook. Users can select the type of cuisine they want to prepare, and the app supports filters, allowing users to easily find recipes based on their chosen criteria.

## Key Features
1. Categories Screen – Food options are categorized into 10 selections. The Categories Screen uses a grid view to display options, a bottom navigation bar to switch to the Favorites Screen, and an icon to open the side drawer.
2. Side Drawer – The side drawer allows users to navigate to the Filters Screen and Categories Screen.
3. Filters Screen – A screen for filtering foods based on subcategories. It includes four filters controlled by switch buttons.
4. Empty Meals Screen – Displays when no food options are available after applying filters on the Meals Screen.
5. Meals Screen – Shows a variety of food options based on selected categories and filters. Food items are displayed with images and various details about the dishes.
6. Meal Details Screen – Provides detailed information about a selected dish from the Meals Screen, including food images, ingredients, and preparation steps. An action bar features a star icon to mark the dish as a favorite.
7. Favorite Meals Screen – Displays dishes marked as favorites on the Meal Details Screen. The layout is similar to the Meals Screen, and selecting an item shows details in the same format as the Meal Details Screen.
